## Summary

**Overall Status: ✅ READY FOR REVIEW**

### Accomplishments

1. Complete Tailwind CSS setup with dark mode default
2. shadcn/ui fully configured and 6 components installed
3. Complete layout system (Header, Footer, Sidebar, MainLayout)
4. Responsive design with mobile hamburger menu
5. Skeleton component pattern established with examples
6. Lucide icons integrated throughout navigation
7. All TypeScript and linting checks pass

### Items Requiring Attention

- ⚠️ **Visual Testing Recommended**: While code compiles and lints correctly, visual verification by running `pnpm dev` is recommended to ensure:
  - Dark mode theme renders correctly
  - Responsive breakpoints work as expected
  - Mobile menu toggles properly
  - Icons display correctly
  - Layout integrates properly with Clerk auth

### Technical Debt

- None identified. All code follows project standards and patterns.

### Follow-up Work

- Navigation links point to placeholder routes (/snippets, /discussions, /challenges) that will be implemented in future stories
- Sidebar is a shell component ready for future expansion

### Challenges & Learnings

- shadcn/ui initialization required manual configuration file creation
- Tailwind v4 uses different darkMode syntax than v3
- All dependencies properly installed and configured
