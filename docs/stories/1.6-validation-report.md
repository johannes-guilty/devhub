# Story 1.6 Validation Report

**Date:** 2026-01-24
**Story:** docs/stories/1.6.story.md
**Task:** .bmad-core/tasks/validate-next-story.md

## 1. Template Compliance Issues

> [!WARNING]
> **Missing Sections**
>
> - **Change Log**: The `Change Log` table is missing. This is required by the template (`story-tmpl.yaml`).
> - **Dev Agent Record**: Missing placeholders for `Dev Agent Record` and its subsections.
> - **QA Results**: Missing placeholder for `QA Results`.

> [!NOTE]
> **Structure Deviation**
>
> - **Testing Section**: `Test Strategy` is located as a top-level section. The template defines `Testing` as a subsection under `Dev Notes`.

## 2. File Structure and Source Tree Validation

- **Status:** PASS
- **Notes:**
  - `src/components/pagebuilder/` is correctly identified.
  - `src/app/(marketing)/page.tsx` matches architecture for landing page.
  - `block-renderer.tsx` placement is correct.

## 3. UI/Frontend Completeness

- **Status:** PASS
- **Notes:**
  - Block components (Hero, Features, CTA) are defined.
  - **Mandatory Skeleton Components** are explicitly mentioned in tasks (Good).
  - Responsive requirements are present.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria Satisfaction

- **Status:** PASS
- **Coverage:**
  - AC 1-3 covered by Tasks 1 & 2.
  - AC 4 & 8 covered by Tasks 3 & 4.
  - AC 5 & 7 covered by Task 5.
  - AC 6 covered by Task 6 (Verification).

## 5. Validation and Testing Instructions

- **Status:** PASS
- **Notes:**
  - Manual verification steps are clear and cover the user workflow (Admin -> Frontend).
  - No new E2E tests required is stated.

## 6. Security Considerations

- **Status:** NEUTRAL
- **Notes:**
  - Implicitly relies on Payload's admin auth.
  - **Suggestion:** explicit confirmation that the `pages` collection is public (or uses strictly server-side fetching via local API as implied) would be better, but "Implement logic to fetch... from Payload" in Task 5 (Server Component) implies secure local access.

## 7. Tasks/Subtasks Sequence

- **Status:** PASS
- **Notes:**
  - Logical flow: Backend (Payload) -> Frontend (Components) -> Integration (Renderer/Page) -> Verification.

## 8. Anti-Hallucination Verification

- **Status:** PASS
- **Notes:**
  - References to `shadcn/ui`, `Tailwind v4`, and `Payload` architecture align with `docs/architecture.md`.
  - No invented libraries found.

## 9. Final Assessment

> [!TIP]
> **Implementation Readiness Score: 9/10**
> The story is technically sound and ready for implementation. The only issues are structural (template compliance).

**Recommendation:**

- **Add the missing `Change Log` section.**
- **Add the missing `Dev Agent Record` and `QA Results` sections** (even if empty) to ensure the artifact lifecycle is tracked correctly.
- **Move `Test Strategy` to `Dev Notes`** (optional, but cleaner for template compliance).

**GO / NO-GO:** **GO** (Conditional on adding Change Log)
