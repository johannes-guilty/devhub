    severity: low
    finding: "Code duplication: Helper functions (mapClerkRoleToPrisma, generateUsername, formatDisplayName) duplicated between webhook handler and sync-user endpoint"

    notes: "Webhook endpoint lacks rate limiting. Signature verification is properly implemented. Auth checks are in place throughout."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No performance concerns. Database queries are efficient. Middleware is lightweight."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Good error handling. Manual sync endpoint provides fallback. Webhook retries handled by Clerk."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Well-documented code with clear comments. Good separation of concerns. Minor code duplication noted."

recommendations:
  immediate:
    - action: "Add rate limiting to webhook endpoint"
      refs: ["src/app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts"]
      rationale: "Prevent abuse and ensure webhook endpoint stability"
  future:
    - action: "Extract shared Clerk helper functions to reduce duplication"
      refs: ["src/app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts", "src/app/api/sync-user/route.ts"]
      rationale: "Improve maintainability and reduce risk of inconsistencies"
